## Description

The project builds a weather station which should provide real-time weather data on an external display and web interface

## Motivation

Building a Raspberry Pi Pico W weather station with embassy-rs combined my interest in embedded systems with a chance to explore networking. It allowed me to learn sensor interaction, data processing, and real-time programming. Integrating a web interface adds a network layer, enabling real-time data display and opening doors for future functionalities like remote monitoring.

## Architecture 

Add here the schematics with the architecture of your project. Make sure to include:
 - what are the main components (architecture components, not hardware components)
 - how they connect with each other

## Log

<!-- write every week your progress here -->

### Week 6 - 12 May

### Week 7 - 19 May

### Week 20 - 26 May

## Hardware

We will use a BME280 in order to gather environmental data. The Pico will process this gathered data in order to print meaningful graphics on the provided display. We will also use several push buttons in order to switch between the available data

### Schematics

Place your KiCAD schematics here.
