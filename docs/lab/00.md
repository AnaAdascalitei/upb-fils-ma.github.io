## Basic programming language concepts for Rust

### Standard library

By default, Rust has a set of elements defined in the standard library that are imported into the program of each application. This set is called the *prelude*, and you can look it up in the standard
library [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html) .

If a type you want to use is not in the prelude, you must bring that type into scope explicitly with a `use`
statement. Using the `std::io` module gives you a number of useful features, including the ability to accept
user input.

```rust
use std::io; 
```

### The `main` function

The `main` function is the entry point of our program.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

We use `println!` macro to print messages on the screen.

To insert a placeholder in the `println!` macro, use a *pair of braces* `{}` . We provide the variable name or
expression to replace the provided placeholder outside the string.

```rust
fn main() {

    let name = "Mary";
    let age = 26;

    println!("Hello, {}. You are {} years old", name, age);
    // if the replacements are only variable, one can use the inline version
    println!("Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old");
}
```

### Variables and mutability

We use the `let` keyword to create a variable.

```rust
    let a = 5;
```

By default, in Rust, variables are **immutable** , meaning once a value is tied to a name, you cannot
change that value.

Example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

In this case, we will get a compilation error because we are trying to modify the value of `x` from `5` to `6`, but
`x` is immutable, so we cannot make this modification.

Although variables are immutable by default, you can make them **mutable** by adding `mut` in front of the
variable name. Adding `mut` also conveys intent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts
of the code will modify the value of this variable.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

Now the value of `x` can become `6`.

### Constants

Like immutable variables, constants are values that are tied to a name and **are not allowed to change**,
but there are some differences between constants and variables.

First of all, you are not allowed to use `mut` with constants. Constants are not only immutable by default,
they are always immutable. You declare constants using the `const` keyword instead of the let keyword .

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

### Data Types

#### Scalar types

A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four main scalar types: integers, floating point numbers,
booleans, and characters.

**Integer** â†’ Each variant can be signed or unsigned and has an explicit size.
```rust
let x: i8 = -2;
let y: u16 = 25;
```

| Length              | Signed | Unsigned | Java Equivalent |
| :----------------: | :------: | :----: | :----: |
| 8-bit |   `i8`   | `u8` | `byte`/ `Byte`[^java_unsigned] |
| 16-bit |   `i16`   | `u16` | `short` / `Short`[^java_unsigned] |
| 32-bit |   `i32`   | `u32` | `int` / `Integer`[^java_unsigned] |
| 64-bit |   `i64`   | `u64` | `long` / `Long`[^java_unsigned] |
| 128-bit |   `i128`   | `u128` | N/A |
| arch |   `isize`   | `usize` | N/A |

**Floating Point** â†’ Rust's floating point types are `f32` and `f64`, which are 32-bit and 64-bit in size, respectively. The default type is `f64` because on modern CPUs it is about the same speed as `f32` but is capable of more precision. All floating point types are **signed**.

| Length              | Floating point | Java Equivalent|
| :----------------: | :------: | :----: | 
| 32-bit | `f32` | `float`/ `Float` |
| 64-bit | `f64` | `double` / `Double`|



```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64
    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

**Boolean** â†’ Booleans are one byte in size. Boolean type in Rust is specified using bool.

```rust
let t = true;
let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
```

**Character** â†’ The Rust char type is the most primitive alphabetic type in the language.

```rust
let c = 'z';
let z: char = 'â„¤'; // with explicit type annotation
let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
```

#### Compound types

**Tuple** â†’ A tuple is a structure used for grouping a number of values â€‹â€‹with a variety of types into a single compound type. Tuples have a **fixed** length  : once declared, their size cannot increase or decrease.

```rust
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
```

**Array** â†’ Unlike a tuple, each element in an array must have the **same type**. Unlike arrays in some other languages, Rust arrays have a **fixed** length.

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

### Functions

We define a function in Rust by entering fn followed by a function name and a set of parentheses. Curly braces tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
 
    another_function();
}
 
fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```
- ### Settings

We can define functions with parameters, which are special variables that are part of a function's signature. When a function has parameters, you can provide it with **concrete values** â€‹â€‹for those parameters.

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}
 
fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

:::tip 

In function signatures you must declare the type of each parameter!

:::

- ### Declarations vs. expressions

Function bodies consist of a series of instructions optionally ending with an expression.

Declarations are **statements** that perform an action and do not return a value.

Expressions evaluate to a resulting value .

:::tip 

For a better understanding, please read [chapter 3](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html) of the documentation.

:::

- ### Functions with return values

Functions can return values â€‹â€‹to the code that calls them. We don't name the return values, but we must declare their type after **an arrow (â†’)**. In Rust, the function's return value is synonymous with the value of **the final expression** in a function's body block. You can return earlier from a function by using the return keyword and specifying a value, but most functions implicitly return the last expression.

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}
 
fn main() {
    let x = five();
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");// "The value of x is: 5"
}
```

:::

### Control flow

#### If-else
All if expressions start with the if keyword , followed by a condition. Optionally, we can also include an else expression.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;
 
    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

You can use multiple conditions by combining if and else in an else if expression:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;
 
    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

Because if is an expression, we can use it on **the right side** of a let statement to assign the result to a variable.

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };
 
    println!("The value of number is: {number}");//"The value of the number is 5"
}
```
#### loop

The `loop` keyword tells Rust to run a block of code over and over forever or until you **explicitly** tell it to stop.

```rust
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```
One use of a loop is to retry an operation that you know might fail, such as checking if a thread has finished its work. You may also need to pass the result of this operation out of the loop to the rest of your code. To do this, you can add the value you want to return after the break expression you use to stop the loop; this value will be returned out of the loop so you can use it:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;
 
    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;
 
        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };
 
    println!("The result is {result}");
}
```

#### while
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;
 
    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");
 
        number -= 1;
    }
 
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

#### for
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
 
    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}
```

### Structures

Structs are similar to tuples, in that they both contain multiple related values . Like tuples, pieces of a structure can be of different types. Unlike tuples, in a structure you **will name** each piece of data so that the meaning of the values â€‹â€‹is clear.

To define a structure, we enter the `struct` keyword and name the entire structure. The name of a structure should describe the meaning of the data elements grouped together. Then, within curly brackets, we define the names and types of the data, which we call **fields**.

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
```

To use a structure after having defined it, we create an **instance** of this structure by specifying concrete values â€‹â€‹for each of the fields. We create an instance by specifying the structure **name , then add curly braces containing key:value pairs** , where the keys are the field names and the values â€‹â€‹are the data we want to store in those fields.

```rust
fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
```

To access a certain member of the struct we use this syntax:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
 
    user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com")
}
```

:::tip 

Note that the entire instance must be **editable**  ; Rust **doesn't allow us** to mark only certain fields as mutable!

:::

As with any expression, we can construct a new instance of the structure as the last expression in the function body to implicitly return this new instance.

```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        active: true,
        username: username,
        email: email,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```
#### Tuple structs

Rust also supports structures that resemble tuples, called **tuple structs** . Tuple structures have the additional meaning provided by the structure name but do not have names associated with their fields; instead, they just have the field types. Tuple structures are useful when you want to name the entire tuple and make it a different type from other tuples, and when naming each field as in a regular structure would be wordy or redundant.

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
 
fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
```

### String
Rust has only one type of string in the base language, which is the string slice str which is usually seen in its borrowed form **&str** .

The **String** type , which is provided by the Rust standard library rather than encoded in the main language, is a scalable, mutable, and owned UTF-8 encoded string type .

#### Creating a new String
```rust
    let mut s = String::new();
```
This line creates a new empty string called `s`, which we can then load data into.

**We can use the String::from** function or the **to_string()** function to create a string from a string literal:
```rust
    let s = String::from("initial contents");
```
```rust
let data = "initial contents";
 
    let s = data.to_string();
 
    // the method also works on a literal directly:
    let s = "initial contents".to_string();
```

#### Adding to a string

We can expand a string using the **push_str** method to add a string slice.
```rust
let mut s = String::from("foo");
s.push_str("bar");
```
**The push** method takes **a single character** as a parameter and adds it to the string.

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("lo");
    s.push('l');
```
#### Iteration Methods on Strings

The best way to operate on pieces of strings is to be explicit about whether you want characters or bytes. For individual Unicode scalar values, use the **chars** method .
```rust
for c in "Ð—Ð´".chars() {
    println!("{c}");
}
```
### Run the program
In order to run the program we may be anywhere in the crate's folder and execute the command:

```bash
cargo run
```
