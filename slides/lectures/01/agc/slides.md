# *We choose to go to the moon*
John F. Kennedy, Rice University, 1961

*in this decade and do the other things, **not because they are easy, but because they are hard**, because **that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills**, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.*
